SysY Runtime Library (2022 Edition)
The SysY runtime library provides a set of I/O functions, timing functions, and
other facilities used to express input/output, timing, and similar requirements
in SysY programs. These library functions can be used inside SysY functions
without being declared in the SysY program itself. It should be noted that some
SysY library functions accept parameter types beyond the data types supported
by SysY, such as strings. A SysY compiler must be able to handle such cases
and correctly pass these arguments from a SysY program to the SysY runtime
library.
1. Files Related to the Runtime Library
The contest organizers provide the following SysY runtime library files to con￾testants:
• libsysy.a and libsysy.so are the static and dynamic versions of the
SysY runtime library, respectively, for the contest target platform. For
fairness, final evaluation will uniformly use static linking.
• sylib.h contains declarations of the functions and other items involved
in the SysY runtime library.
Note: SysY source programs do not include sylib.h; instead, the SysY compiler
analyzes and handles calls to these functions in SysY programs.
2. I/O Functions
The SysY runtime library provides a series of I/O functions that support input
and output of integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and sequences of
integers or floating-point numbers. To make it easier to control output format
in SysY programs, I/O functions such as putf accept parameters beyond the
data types supported by the SysY language, such as format strings.
The SysY runtime library provides the following I/O functions. Their arguments
may be integer values, floating-point values, variables, or array element access
expressions.1
1. int getint()
Reads an integer and returns its value.
Example: int n; n = getint();
2. int getch()
Reads a character and returns its ASCII code.
Example: int n; n = getch();
3. float getfloat()
Reads a floating-point number and returns its value.
Example: float n; n = getfloat();
1Compared with the 2020 edition, SysY2022 adds the float basic type and supports mul￾tidimensional arrays whose element type is float.

4. int getarray(int[])
Reads a sequence of integers. The first integer indicates how many inte￾gers follow; this count is returned as the function result. The subsequent
integers are returned through the array argument.
Note: getarray obtains the starting address of the array passed in. It does
not check whether the caller-provided array has enough space to hold the
input sequence.
Example: int a[10][10]; int n; n = getarray(a[0]);
5. int getfarray(float[])
Reads an integer followed by several floating-point numbers. The first
integer indicates how many floating-point numbers follow; this count is
returned as the function result. The subsequent floating-point numbers
are returned through the array argument.
Note: getfarray obtains the starting address of the array passed in. It
does not check whether the caller-provided array has enough space to hold
the input sequence.
Example: float a[10][10]; int n; n = getfarray(a[0]);
6. void putint(int)
Outputs the value of an integer.
Example: int n = 10; putint(n); putint(10); putint(n);
Output: 101010
7. void putch(int)
Interprets the integer argument as an ASCII code and outputs the corre￾sponding character.
Note: The valid range of the integer argument is 0 to 255. putch() does
not check argument validity.
Example: int n = 10; putch(n);
Output: a newline character
8. void putfloat(float)
Outputs the value of a floating-point number.
Example: float n = 10.0; putfloat(n); putfloat(10.0); putfloat(n);
Output: 10.00000010.00000010.000000
9. void putarray(int, int[])
The first argument indicates how many integers are to be output (suppose
this number is N). It should be followed by an array containing the N inte￾gers to output. putarray inserts spaces between integers when printing.
Note: putarray does not check argument validity.
Example: int n = 2; int a[] = {2, 3}; putarray(n, a);
2
Output: 2:2 3
10. void putfarray(int, float[])
The first argument indicates how many floating-point numbers are to be
output (suppose this number is N). It should be followed by an array
containing the N floating-point numbers to output. putfarray inserts
spaces between floating-point numbers when printing.
Note: putfarray does not check argument validity.
Example: int n = 2; float a[] = {2.0, 3.0}; putfarray(n, a);
Output: 2:2.000000 3.000000
11. void putf(<format string>, int, ...)
The first argument is a format string that may contain only three format
specifiers: %d, %c, and %f. The function outputs according to the format
string. Ordinary characters are output as-is. When %d, %c, or %f is en￾countered, the function takes the corresponding argument starting from
the second parameter and outputs it as an integer, character, or floating￾point number, respectively.
Example:
int n = 2;
int a[] = {2, 3};
putf("%d: %d(%c), %d(%c)", n, a[0], a[0] + 48, a[1], a[1] + 48);
Output: 2:2(2), 3(3)
3. Timing Functions
The SysY runtime library provides a pair of functions, starttime and stoptime,
for timing the execution of a segment of code in SysY. A SysY program may
insert multiple pairs of starttime/stoptime calls to obtain the execution time
of the code between each pair, and the cumulative execution time of all such
timed segments is reported when the SysY program finishes execution. Note that
starttime and stoptime do not support nested calls; that is, a call sequence
such as starttime() ... starttime() ... stoptime() ... stoptime() is
not supported.
The timing interfaces are as follows:
12. void starttime()
Starts the timer. This function should be used together with stoptime().
13. void stoptime()
Stops the timer. This function should be used together with starttime().
When the program finishes, it outputs the time spent by each timer and
the cumulative total for all timers.
Format: Timer#number@start-line-stop-line: hour-minute-second-microsecond
Example:
3
void foo(int n) {
starttime();
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) system("sleep 1");
stoptime();
}
int main() {
starttime();
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) system("sleep 1");
stoptime();
foo(2);
}
Output:
Timer#001@0010-0012: 0H-0M-3S-3860us
Timer#002@0005-0007: 0H-0M-2S-2660us
TOTAL: 0H-0M-5S-6520us
